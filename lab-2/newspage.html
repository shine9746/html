        <p>Consumers are expected to do much of their shopping online this year even as the pandemic recedes, and criminals are expected to follow them.
        So here are some tips for safe digital shopping. 
        There has seen a surge in online <strong>card fraud</strong> in recent years, and it accelerated during the pandemic as more people shopped on the internet to avoid
        brick-and-mortar stores, according to a report.
        Losses from online card fraud are expected to reach almost $8 billion by the end of this year, up from a about $6 billion in 2019, the report said.
        At the same time, consumers still expect to do about two-thirds of their holiday spending this year online, even though they feel less anxious about 
        shopping in stores, according to a holiday retail survey published this past week by Deloitte.
        And with tight supplies of merchandise and shipping delays from the lingering effects of the pandemic, holiday shoppers may turn to less familiar, 
        less secure websites in search of the perfect gift.</p>


        <p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 251, 213);">Credit cards are often considered the safest payment option when shopping online because they have strong, consumer protections.</span>If you have a 
        disagreement with a merchant or receive a defective product and can’t resolve the problem yourself, you can dispute it with your card company.
        <em>“The credit card goes to bat on your behalf”</em>, said <strong>Chuck Bell</strong>, programs director of advocacy with Consumer Reports.
        And if your card is stolen or hacked and you spot unauthorized charges, you aren’t liable for them.
        In addition, the major payment networks generally go beyond the requirements and extend zero fraud liability for credit card and certain debit card
        transactions, according to WalletHub.Even so, having a card hacked can be a hassle. You’ll need to take time to report the matter to your card issuer.
        It will generally cancel your card and issueone with a new number, so you will need to reset any recurring payments or subscriptions.
        For that reason, some shoppers may want to consider options like “virtual” credit cards or digital wallets, which add an extra layer of security when you use them.</p>

        <p>Virtual cards are, in effect, temporary card numbers issued by your card company that are used to mask your real card number. You enter the virtual number when shopping
        online, and the merchant never sees your actual card number. So if the website is <em>fraudulent</em>, or if a legitimate site is breached, your card number isn’t exposed.
        In some cases, there may be an extra step to take to use a virtual card. You must retrieve the virtual number from your credit card’s website and then enter it on the website 
        where you’re shopping, said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com. It doesn’t take long, but the added time may discourage some shoppers, he said.
        Services like GooglePay can also add protection when payment cards are used.</p>

       <p>Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card.
        The purpose may be to obtain goods or services or to make payment to another account, which is controlled by a criminal. 
        <strong>The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</strong> is the data security standard created to help financial institutions 
        process card payments securely and reduce card fraud.

       Credit card fraud can be authorised, where the genuine customer themselves processes a payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal, or unauthorised,
       where the account holder does not provide authorisation for the payment to proceed and the transaction is carried out by a third party. In 2018, unauthorised financial
       fraud losses across payment cards and remote banking totalled £844.8 million in the United Kingdom. Whereas banks and card companies prevented £1.66 billion in unauthorised 
       fraud in 2018. That is the equivalent to £2 in every £3 of attempted fraud being stopped.</p>
    
       <p>Credit cards are more secure than ever, with regulators, card providers and banks taking considerable time and effort to collaborate with investigators worldwide to ensure
       fraudsters aren'tsuccessful. Cardholders' money is usually protected from scammers with regulations that make the card provider and bank accountable. The technology and security
       measures behind credit cards are becoming increasingly sophisticated making it harder for fraudsters to steal money.
       Card information is stored in a number of formats. Card numbers  formally the <strong>Primary Account Number (PAN)</strong> are often embossed or imprinted on the card, and a magnetic stripe on the 
       back contains the data in a machine-readable format. Fields can vary, but the most common include Name of the card holder; Card number; Expiration date; and Verification CVV code.
       In Europe and Canada, most cards are equipped with an EMV chip which requires a 4 to 6 digit PIN to be entered into the merchant's terminal before payment will be authorized.
       However, a PIN isn't required for online transactions. In some European countries, if you don't have a card with a chip, you may be asked for photo-ID at the point of sale.</p>
        
       <p>In some countries, a credit card holder can make a contactless payment for goods or services by tapping their card against a RFID</strong> or <strong>NFC</strong> reader without the need for
       a PIN or signature if the cost falls under a pre-determined limit. However, a stolen credit or debit card could be used for a number of smaller transactions prior to the fraudulent
       activity being flagged.Card issuers maintain several countermeasures, including software that can estimate the probability of fraud. For example, a large transaction occurring a great distance
       from the cardholder's home might seem suspicious. The merchant may be instructed to call the card issuer for verification or to decline the transaction, or even to hold the card and refuse to 
       return it to the customer.</p>

    <p>Between July 2005 and mid-January 2007, a breach of systems at TJX Companies exposed data from more than 45.6 million credit cards.
    <em>Albert Gonzalez</em> is accused of being the ringleader of the group responsible for the thefts. In August 2009 Gonzalez was also indicted
    for the biggest known credit card theft to date — information from more than 130 million credit and debit cards was stolen at Heartland
    Payment Systems, retailers 7-Eleven and Hannaford Brothers, and two unidentified companies.
    In 2012, about 40 million sets of payment card information were compromised by a hack of Adobe Systems.
    The information compromised included customer names, encrypted payment card numbers, expiration dates, 
    and information relating to orders, Chief Security Officer Brad Arkin said.</p>
    
    <p>In July 2013, press reports indicated four Russians and a Ukrainian were indicted in the U.S. state of 
    New Jersey for what was called "the largest hacking and data breach scheme ever prosecuted in the United States."
    <em>Albert Gonzalez</em> was also cited as a co-conspirator of the attack, which saw at least 160 million credit card losses 
    and excess of $300 million in losses. The attack affected both American and European companies including Citigroup,
    Nasdaq OMX Group, PNC Financial Services Group, Visa licensee Visa Jordan, Carrefour, J. C. Penny and JetBlue Airways.
    Between 27 November 2013 and 15 December 2013, a breach of systems at Target Corporation exposed data from about 40 
    million credit cards. The information stolen included names, account numbers, expiry dates, and card security codes.
    From 16 July to 30 October 2013, a hacking attack compromised about a million sets of payment card data stored on 
    computers at Neiman-Marcus. A malware system, designed to hook into cash registers and monitor the credit 
    card authorisation process <em>(RAM-scraping malware)</em>, infiltrated Target's systems and exposed information from as many as 110 million customers.</p>
    
    <p>On 8 September 2014, The Home Depot confirmed that their payment systems were compromised. They later released a statement saying that
    the hackers obtained a total of 56 million credit card numbers as a result of the breach.
    On 15 May 2016, in a coordinated attack, a group of around 100 individuals used the data of 1600 
    South African credit cards to steal <strong>US$12.7 million</strong> from 1400 convenience stores in Tokyo within three hours.
    By acting on a Sunday and in another country than the bank which issued the cards, they are believed to have won enough time to leave Japan
    before the heist was discovered.</p>

    <p><em>Here are some questions and answers about safe practices when shopping online:</em></p><!--Italic/emphasis applied-->
     
    <strong>How else can I protect myself?</strong><!--strong applied-->
    <ol ><!--ordered list applied-->
    <li>Vet unfamiliar websites before shopping by searching online for the merchant’s name and the word “complaint” or “scam,”, and read the seller’s 
    description of the goods carefully. If the seller offers brand-name goods at steep discounts, “they might be fakes.”</li>
    <li>It is also recommended to make sure the website shows a tiny lock icon, or https, in the checkout browser, indicating transactions are secure.
    You can also sign up for alerts from your bank or credit card so you are notified when purchases are made.</li>
    <li>If major retailers are out of an item, there’s a good chance an online seller you have never heard of doesn’t have it, either. And if a website 
    asks for your other personal details that should be a red flag that the site is not legitimate.</li>
    </ol>
                
<br>

    <strong>Can I use a debit card to shop online?</strong>  
    <ol >
    <li>You can, but experts generally caution against it. That’s because if the card is compromised, funds are taken directly from your bank account.</li>
    <li>There are consumer protections in place, but it may take time to resolve the issue and in the meantime you may be out the cash.</li>
    </ol>
                
<br>

    <strong>What about ‘buy now, pay later’ services?</strong>
    <ol>
    <li>Online retailers are increasingly offering a buy now, pay later option at checkout; it allows you to buy an item and pay for it in installments. 
    Many online shoppers began using this type of credit during the pandemic. But these options lack the same buyer protections as traditional credit cards.</li>
    <li>The providers let you pay for an item over time, as a credit card does, but without interest. Still, they may charge hefty late fees if you miss payments, 
    and they don’t have the same dispute protections as credit cards do if the product is faulty or damaged or turns out to be part of a scam.</li>
    <li>And returning items bought with these services may be complicated. You may be responsible for the total cost of a purchase even after you’ve returned it.</li>
    <li>Be sure, to carefully read. </li>
    </ol>
